# Human-Activity-Recognition
Human Activity Recognition using mobile phoneâ€™s accelerometer and gyroscope data

<br>


This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.

This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

###  Y_Labels(Encoded)
+ In the dataset, Y_labels are represented as numbers from 1 to 6 as their identifiers.

	- WALKING as __1__
	- WALKING_UPSTAIRS as __2__
	- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS as __3__
	- SITTING as __4__
	- STANDING as __5__
	- LAYING as __6__
