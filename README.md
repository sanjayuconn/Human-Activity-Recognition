# Human-Activity-Recognition
Human Activity Recognition using mobile phoneâ€™s accelerometer and gyroscope data

<br>


This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.

This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

## Problem Statement

 + Given a new datapoint we have to predict the Activity
