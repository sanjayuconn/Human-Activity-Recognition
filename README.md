This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.

This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

### Feature names

1. These sensor signals are preprocessed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width windows(sliding windows) of 2.56 seconds each with 50% overlap. ie., each window has 128 readings. 

2. From Each window, a feature vector was obtianed by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
> In our dataset, each datapoint represents a window with different readings 
3. The accelertion signal was saperated into Body and Gravity acceleration signals(___tBodyAcc-XYZ___ and ___tGravityAcc-XYZ___) using some low pass filter with corner frequecy of 0.3Hz.

4. After that, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtian _jerk signals_ (___tBodyAccJerk-XYZ___ and ___tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ___). 

5. The magnitude of these 3-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidian norm. This magnitudes are represented as features with names like _tBodyAccMag_, _tGravityAccMag_, _tBodyAccJerkMag_, _tBodyGyroMag_ and _tBodyGyroJerkMag_.

6. Finally, We've got frequency domain signals from some of the available signals by applying a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). These signals obtained were labeled with ___prefix 'f'___ just like original signals with ___prefix 't'___. These signals are labeled as ___fBodyAcc-XYZ___, ___fBodyGyroMag___ etc.,.

7. These are the signals that we got so far.
